/**
 *
 * These exercises use the data classes and enums defines in [AppInfo]
 *
 * The main data class keeps information on Android Play Store apps, and looks like this:
 *
 * data class AppInfo(
 *     val name: String,
 *     val reviews: Int,
 *     val price: Price = Price(0.0),
 *     val genres: Set<Genre> = emptySet(),
 *     val category: Category? = null,
 *     val rating: Rating? = null,
 *     val size: Size? = null,
 *     val installs: InstallBase? = null,
 *     val type: Type? = null,
 *     val contentRating: ContentRating? = null
 * )
 *
 * the data which is loaded from "src/main/resources/googleplaystore.csv" has some missing or bad values,
 * which is why many of the [AppInfo] properties are nullable.
